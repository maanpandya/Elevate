    Computes the degree of controllability based on the recovery region.

    The recovery region is defined as the set of states that can be controlled to the origin in a specified time and control input.
    The value of the DOC varies based on the recovery time.
    In this method, in general, the smaller the discretization interval is, the higher the accuracy is, but the higher the computational complexity.

        B: np.ndarray. System input matrix of the state-space model of an LTI system.
