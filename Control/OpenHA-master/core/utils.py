def split_dataset(X: list, Y: list, percent: float = 0.15) -> tuple:
    '''
    Split the dataset into train and test subsets randomly.

    Split the dataset with features `X` and labels `Y` into `X1, X2, Y1, Y2` randomly.
    The order of the features and their corresponding labels remain unchanged.
    The ratio of the number of features in `X1` to that of `X` is 15% as default.

    It's similar to the function `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.

    Args:
        X: list. An array of feature vectors.
        Y: list. An array of labels.
        percent: float, optional. The proportion of the dataset to include in the train split.

    Returns:
        A tuple, namely (X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
